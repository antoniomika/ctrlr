ctrlr - A (smart) home controller
=====

Why make this?
----

- I was unhappy with a lot of the commercial smart home tools out there today and figured I could do better. I also was tired of having things that weren't "smart", so this tool accomplishes both things.

How do I use this?
----
- The project is based off of the [Particle photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi/), a simple IoT device that uses your home's wifi

What does it look like?
